# mark-installs
SlackBuild installation tool, originally written in C, then rewritten in bash, then rewritten in Perl. This is obviously not intended to replace/improve pkgtools in any way. This tool is purely for convenience's sake.

To install, I recommend enabling execution and move to `/usr/local/bin/`
