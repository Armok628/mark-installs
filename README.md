# mark-installs
SlackBuild installation tool, written in C and bash. This is not intended to replace/improve pkgtools in any way. This is intended to be more like a supplement, for convenience's sake.

To install/uninstall/reinstall the program, use ./mjinstall

Warning: This program is garbage. It works, but it uses more system() calls than needed, and segfaults in some circumstances. This project is very old, and was not uploaded to github for a long time. I was horribly inexperienced; I intend to right this someday, and hopefully include some rudimentary dependency checking in the future, but since I'm probably the only person who will ever use it, I might not bother.
