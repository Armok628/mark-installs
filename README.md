# mark-installs
SlackBuild installation tool, written in C and bash

To install/uninstall/reinstall the program, use ./mjinstall

Warning: this program is garbage. It uses more system() calls than needed, and segfaults in some circumstances. This project is very old, and was not uploaded to github for a long time. I was horribly inexperienced, and I intend to right this someday, and hopefully include some rudimentary dependency checking in the future.
